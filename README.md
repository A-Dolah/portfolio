# My personal blog and portfolio website

This is a site that I started late 2019 as a place to collect notes on different coding topics, links to useful resources as well as some information about me and my transitioning from practicing law to programming.

The site not completely done, but complete enough for anyone to view :). I try to post blog posts and reading posts as often as possible.

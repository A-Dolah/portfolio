# My personal blog and portfolio website

This is a site that I started late 2019 as a place to collect notes on different coding topics, links to useful resources as well as some information about me and my transitioning from practicing law to programming.

The stack for this site is:

1. **React**, implemented through **Gatsby**
2. **Contentful**, for content management
3. **Netlify**, for hosting and deployment

I've written more about how and why I built the site [here](https://www.adamdolah.com/blog/mysite)!

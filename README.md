# My personal blog and portfolio website

This is a site that I started late 2019 as a place to collect notes on different coding topics, links to useful resources as well as some information about me and my transitioning from practicing law to programming.

The stack for this site is: 
1. **React**, implemented through **Gatsby**
2. **Contentful**, for content management
3. **Netlify**, for deployment
    
I can highly recommend the above setup for managing a blog. Pulling data into Gatsby using the Contentful GraphQL API is a breeze and having the Contenful GUI for typing and adding assets is very comfortable (contra using markdown files for example). Netlify and Contentful also go very well together using a _Netlify build hook_ so that the site updates when every new post is published (beware though, you might run out of your free build minutes on Netlify).

The site is not completely done, but complete enough for anyone to view. I try to post blog posts and reading posts as often as possible.
